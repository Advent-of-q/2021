# Advent of q

![Dojo](./img/dojo.jpg)

The annual [Advent of Code competition](https://adventofcode.com) has become a programmers’ Christmas tradition: a daily series of puzzles of varying difficulty to solve and discuss.

The 2021 challenge raised the excitement level in the Vector Dōjō because the puzzles are particularly susceptible to vector solutions. 


## The birth of the cool

We nod to code golfers who seek the shortest solutions, and to others pursuing the fastest. 
But in the dōjō we are looking for the most ‘vector-ish’ solutions. 
That’s admittedly a bit vague, because it is at bottom an aesthetic criterion. 
(Usually pronounced “cool”.)

As always in the Vector Dōjō, we are more interested in exploring the process of discovery than in the solutions themselves. 
Feel free to chime in with comments and alternatives: what follows is unlikely to be the last word in cool.
